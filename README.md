# NLI4CT_2024
This repository contains my implementation for the [NLI4CT](https://sites.google.com/view/nli4ct/) at SemEval 2024. The dataset, which was published together with the task, contains clinical trial reports (CTRs) and annotated statements. The task of the model is to decide if the statement follows from given information from up to two CTRs (see example below). For full details, see the [dataset paper](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.1041.pdf).
